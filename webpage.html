        <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=artificial+intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a></b>is intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science,the field of AI research defines itself as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.

        <ol>
            <li>[1] Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".</li>

          <li>[2] As machines become increasingly capable, mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. For example, optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an exemplar of "artificial intelligence", having become a routine technology.</li>

            <li>[3] Capabilities currently classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech,</li>

            <li>[4] competing at a high level in strategic game systems <b>(such as Chess and Go</b>
            </li>

            <li>[5]<b>self-driving</b> cars,intelligent routing in Content Delivery Networks, and interpreting complex data.AI research is divided into subfields</li>

            <li>[6] that focus on specific problems or on specific approaches or on the use of a particular tool or towards satisfying particular applications. The central problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing (communication), perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.</li>

            <li>[7] General intelligence is among the field's long-term goals.[8] Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, logic, methods based on probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and artificial psychology.</li>

        <h2 id="2">How to get started in AI</h2>
        <p>The promise of artificial intelligence has captured our cultural imagination since at least the 1950s—inspiring computer scientists to create new and increasingly complex technologies, while also building excitement about the future among regular everyday consumers. </p>
        <p> What if we could explore the bottom of the ocean without taking any physical risks? Or ride around in driverless cars on intelligent roadways? While our understanding of AI—and what’s possible—has changed over the the past few decades, we have reason to believe that the age of artificial intelligence may finally be here. So, as a developer, what can you do to get started? This article will go over some basics of AI, and outline some tools and resources that may help. </p>
        <p>First Things First—What Exactly is AI? While there are a lot of different ways to think about AI and a lot of different techniques to approach it, the key to machine intelligence is that it must be able to sense, reason, and act, then adapt based on experience.</p>
        <p>Sense—Identify and recognize meaningful objects or concepts in the midst of vast data. Is that a stoplight? Is it a tumor or normal tissue? Reason—Understand the larger context, and make a plan to achieve a goal. If the goal is to avoid a collision, the car must calculate the likelihood of a crash based on vehicle behaviors, proximity, speed, and road conditions. Act—Either recommend or directly initiate the best course of action. Based on vehicle and traffic analysis, it may brake, accelerate, or prepare safety mechanismAdapt—Finally, we must be able to adapt algorithms at each phase based on experience, retraining them to be ever more intelligent. Autonomous vehicle algorithms should be re-trained to recognize more blind spots, factor new variables into the context, and adjust actions based on previous incidents</p>

            <li>Science fiction has, for many years, looked to a future in which robots are intelligent and cyborgs are commonplace. The Terminator, The Matrix, Blade Runner and I, Robot are all good examples of this vision.But until the last decade, consideration of what this might actually mean in the future was unnecessary because it was all science fiction, not scientific reality. Now, however, science has not only done some catching up; it’s also introduced practicalities that the original story lines didn’t appear to include (and, in some cases, still don’t include).</li>
            <li>What we consider here are several different experiments linking biology and technology together in a cybernetic way—essentially ultimately combining humans and machines in a relatively permanent merger.</li>
